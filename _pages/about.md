## About Me

Hi! I’m Vijay Adithya C, an undergrad at the [Madras School of Economics](https://www.mse.ac.in). I like working at the edges of economics, mathematics, and philosophy — especially where complex ideas meet the real world.

I was formerly Vice President of [Giffen](https://linktr.ee/giffenecofinmse), the Econ Fin Society at MSE, where we tried to make economic thinking both serious and fun. My interests tend to drift toward niche topics and also toward ideas that I think everyone *should* understand, even if they seem complicated at first.

I enjoy listening to Indian classical music, reading slowly, and thinking about how to make difficult things clearer — both for myself and others.

Thanks for visiting!
